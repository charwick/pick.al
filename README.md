# Student Chooser

A simple app to pick a random student and record participation.

The frontend randomly selects a student from the roster to be called upon, and allows the result to be recorded:

* ✅: Solid effort answering
* ❓: Not paying attention
* ❌: Not present

The backend, in progress, allows class and roster management.

## To do

* Full management and reports in the backend
* Registration and login
* Allow excused absences to be set
