# Pick.al

A lightweight app for picking students at random and recording participation. Register and try it out at [pick.al](https://pick.al).

The picker (to be used on a phone in class) randomly picks a student from the roster to be called upon, and records the result.

[See how it works here](https://twitter.com/C_Harwick/status/1615481096161861632).
