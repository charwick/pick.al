# Student Chooser

A simple app to pick a random student and record participation.

The frontend (to be used on a phone in class) randomly selects a student from the roster to be called upon, and allows the result to be recorded:

* ✅ Solid effort answering
* ❓ Not paying attention
* ❌ Not present

[See how it works here](https://twitter.com/C_Harwick/status/1615481096161861632).

The admin backend, in progress, allows class and roster management. Students can be added to classes either one-by-one or by uploading a CSV, and excused absences can be set so a student's name doesn't come up until a set date.

## To do

* View and edit individual participation events
* Registration and login (OrcId or email)
* Undo and resubmit
