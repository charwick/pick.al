# Pick.al

A lightweight app to pick a random student and record participation. Register and try it out at [pick.al](https://pick.al).

The frontend (to be used on a phone in class) randomly selects a student from the roster to be called upon, and records the result:

* ✅ Solid effort answering
* ❓ Not paying attention
* ❌ Not present

[See how it works here](https://twitter.com/C_Harwick/status/1615481096161861632).

The admin backend allows class and roster management, along with viewing and editing scores and answer histories. Students can be added to classes either one-by-one or by uploading a CSV, and excused absences can be set so a student's name doesn't come up until a set date.

Bug reports and feature requests can be filed in the [issues tab](https://github.com/charwick/pick.al/issues) here on Github.
